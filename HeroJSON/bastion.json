The once-hostile machine now possesses curiosity and a fascination for nature. Along with his bird companion, Ganymede, Bastion has found his way into the care of Torbjorn Lindholm, where he now works to help the humans he once fought against.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/to8yh83jlXg"},"chapters":[{"title":"Omnic crisis","content":"Originally created for peacekeeping purposes, Bastion-E54 robot units possessed the unique ability to rapidly reconfigure themselves into an assault-cannon mode. But during the Omnic Crisis, they were turned against their human makers, forming the bulk of the omnics' rebel army. Following the resolution of the crisis, nearly all of them were destroyed or disassembled. To this day, Bastion units still symbolize the horrors of the conflict. One unique Bastion unit, severely damaged in the final battles of the war, was left forgotten for over a decade. He lay dormant, exposed to the elements and rusting while nature slowly reclaimed him. Overgrown with vines and roots and nested upon by small animals, the robot sat inert, seemingly unaware of the passing of time. That was until one fateful day, when he unexpectedly reactivated. With his combat programming all but lost, he instead displayed an intense curiosity about the natural world and its inhabitants. This inquisitive Bastion unit set out to explore his surroundings and discover his purpose on a war-ravaged planet. Though \"Bastion\" appears to be gentle—even harmless, at times—his core combat programming takes over when the unit senses danger, utilizing his entire arsenal to eliminate anything he perceives as a threat. This led to instances of conflict with the few humans he encountered and drove him to avoid populated areas in favor of the wild, uncharted regions of the world.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt907d9513bdbf532e/638808a9113983111ba8cfaf/bastion-00.jpg"},{"title":"Torbjörn","content":"In his wanderings, Bastion appeared in northern Sweden, where his discovery ignited old fears in the populace. Torbjörn Lindholm, one of the original Bastion unit designers, offered to eliminate him. Amid the hunt, Torbjörn discovered this specific unit was acting counter to his combat directives. Won over by his curiosity and preliminary research, Torbjörn relocated Bastion to his Ironclad Guild, helping the robot survive if he followed the rules. Torbjörn freed Bastion from much of his wartime programming and conducted major repairs on several of Bastion’s decades-old, crumbling systems. Today, Bastion can be found assisting in Torbjörn’s workshop, helping the humans he once fought against.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt2f0367e990f8c4f4/638808a98b3bbe1129cea60a/bastion-01.jpg"}]}}
