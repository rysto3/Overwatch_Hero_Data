With much of her country's infrastructure destroyed, she survived by utilizing her natural gifts with hacking and computers. After Olivia was taken in by Mexico's Los Muertos gang, she aided it in its self-styled revolution against the government. Los Muertos believed that the rebuilding of Mexico had primarily benefited the rich and the influential, leaving behind those who were most in need of assistance. Following her many conquests, Olivia was supremely confident in her skills, but she was caught unprepared when she stumbled into the web of a global conspiracy—one that had also noticed her. With her security irreparably compromised, Olivia was forced to delete all traces of her identity and go into hiding.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blta5830262a146aab0/638810315148880e83ab70d3/sombra-00.jpg"},{"title":"Talon","content":"She later reemerged as Sombra, upgraded and determined to find out the truth behind the conspiracy she had uncovered. Sombra launched an even more audacious string of hacks, and her exploits earned her no shortage of admirers, including Talon. She joined the organization's ranks and is believed to have assisted Reaper in the kidnapping of Dr. Siebren de Kuiper, besides contributing to massive cyberattacks against corporations with strong ties to government. These efforts incited a popular revolution in Mexico against LumériCo and breached the security of Volskaya Industries, the manufacturing arm of Russia's anti-omnic defense. The Volskaya mission in particular highlighted Sombra’s questionable allegiances. Going rogue on an assassination mission against the company’s CEO, Sombra blackmailed her instead. In return, Katya Volskaya sent her own powerful ally, Zarya, after the hacker. Though Zarya was successful in finding Sombra, Sombra revealed Katya’s secret dealings with omnics and escaped. Once Doomfist released himself from prison and reworked Talon’s inner council, Sombra played an important part in the renewed organization, which, more importantly, brought her a few steps closer to her own goal. Olivia led digital terrorism efforts that directly enabled Doomfist to complete his missions in high-value areas such as Rome and Numbani. Whatever services she provides for Talon, only a fool would forget that Sombra’s agenda is her own. But while Sombra remains on the hunt for her prey, Talon gets the best hacker money can’t buy.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltee6e0a3f3af38eb2/638810313b13b1106f74ec60/sombra-01.jpg"}]}}
