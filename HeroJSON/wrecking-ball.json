Hammond taught himself engineering and mechanics, and escaped to earth, landing amidst the Junkers of the Australian Outback. There, he modified his escape pod into a battle mech called Wrecking Ball and became a champion gladiator and the bodyguard of the notorious Junker Queen.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/ZEnC_N06Uxc"},"chapters":[{"title":"Horizon lunar colony","content":"In one of the many experiments carried out at Horizon Lunar Colony, animals were given genetic therapy to assess their adaptation to extended periods of habitation on the moon. As an unexpected side effect, several of them exhibited exceptional growth in physical size and brain function. While most of the test subjects were gorillas or other primates, there were some exceptions, including a hamster named Hammond. Like the others, Hammond's intelligence grew, and he became more curious about the world around him. Much to the puzzlement and amusement of the scientists, Hammond would frequently escape into different parts of the moon base. Though they'd always find him and return him to his cell, they never figured out the true purpose behind his nightly escapades. What they didn't know was that Hammond was busy scavenging and teaching himself the skills of a mechanic, which would soon come in handy.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt8626841dd0a4756e/637da2238b3bbe1129cea43e/wreckingball-00.jpg"},{"title":"Escape","content":"The colony was eventually thrown into chaos when some of the gorillas rose up against the human scientists and took control. Not all of the subjects participated, however, and one of the gorillas, Winston, was making a plan to escape to Earth. Winston was unaware that Hammond too was searching for an exit, and had even designed his own escape pod. Winston unknowingly found Hammond’s plans in the base’s files and got to work. Hammond then built a makeshift capsule and secretly hitched it to Winston's craft as the gorilla blasted off. When the two entered Earth's atmosphere, Hammond broke off and landed in a different location: the wasteland of the Australian Outback.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt4f586f0311507176/637da22332db130e11be7e3d/wreckingball-01.jpg"},{"title":"Junker","content":"Hammond modified his escape pod to enter the lucrative mech battle arena of the Scrapyard. Working his way up the ranks, \"Wrecking Ball\" went from contender to champion, though the pilot's identity remained a mystery to all except one.

After all, as reigning champion of the Scrapyard, he has a title to defend.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt0af3da82e5f25a8b/637da2233cbefd11108110ef/wreckingball-02.jpg"}]}}
