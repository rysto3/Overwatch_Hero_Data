As one of six children, she constantly had to fight to prove her dominance. Her mother, a former Australian Liberation Front cell leader, ran the town watch, and her father, also a former ALF member, negotiated trade with the other settlements. Together they taught Dez the rules of the wasteland, how to operate in a group, and how to survive the irradiated Outback. For those living in the shadow of the ruined Australian omnium, the Omnic Crisis never really ended, it just took a different shape. The survivors and descendants of the ALF and the omnics who roamed the outback clashed in an unending battle for land and resources. Dez and her friends learned to fight from a young age, and quickly formed a posse to hunt Wastelander omnics. She used pieces and equipment of her fallen enemies to craft macabre armor and weapons for herself, including a gauntlet that could manipulate electromagnetism.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt4cb1904358b0203d/637da174443fa70e71d4bee3/junkerqueen-01.jpg"},{"title":"The reckoning","content":"Every few seasons Junkertown hosts the Reckoning—a boisterous, week-long gathering full of feasting, fighting, and shows of strength. Anyone may publicly challenge the reigning Junker monarch provided they defeat all the other challengers first. It’s the main event of the Reckoning: challengers spend all year training, building ostentatious mechs and weaponry, and cultivating juicy rivalries. In her Reckoning debut, Dez tore through the wall of challengers, leveraging her size and experience in the wastelands to defeat more experienced opponents. Even mechs couldn’t stop her; she took them all down using her weapons and unwavering determination. She fought her way to Mason Howl, the reigning Junker King. Their match was legendary with Dez triumphant in the end. The fight—which was filmed and broadcast throughout the Outback—made her wildly popular overnight. It gave her clout with all the factions, which was exactly what she wanted.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt2141bce79c7be4c0/637da1748b3bbe1129cea42e/junkerqueen-02.jpg"},{"title":"Junker queen","content":"After defeating King Howl, Dez took over Junkertown and set to work uniting the factions, one diplomatic beatdown at a time. In time, the Reckoning even produced a champion of her own: Wrecking Ball. Now, as the Junker Queen, Dez uses her wastelander knowledge to control the Junkers and impose order when necessary, training them to fight the omnic menace. That might mean rewarding a faction leader or taking them down. All in a day’s work.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt0e50f459f2475212/637da174bbfd340e8ad2e304/junkerqueen-03.jpg"}]}}
