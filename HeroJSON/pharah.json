Her mother, Ana Amari, was second in command of the organization, though she desired a different life for her daughter, one free from fighting. Still, Fareeha enlisted in the Egyptian army, and her dogged persistence and tactical prowess caused her to rise up through the officer ranks. She was a courageous leader and earned the loyalty of all who served under her. With her exemplary record, Fareeha was well placed to join the ranks of Overwatch, but before she had that opportunity, her mother was killed in the line of duty, and Overwatch was disbanded soon after.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt06773bafb4c60ef4/63880f41c72c2b107a6f7dd8/pharah-00.jpg"},{"title":"Helix","content":"After leaving the army with a commendation for distinguished service, Fareeha was offered employment with Helix Security International, a private security firm contracted to defend the artificial intelligence research facility beneath the Giza Plateau. The top-secret facility was touted as vital to the safety of not only the region but countries across the globe, as it housed the remains of the rogue god program Anubis. Fareeha gladly accepted the choice assignment and received training in the Raptora Mark VI, an experimental combat suit designed for rapid mobility and devastating firepower. Under the call sign \"Pharah,\" she worked to safeguard the AI installation. Years after her mother’s death, Fareeha was shocked to receive a letter from Ana, stating that she was alive, but unable to return to her. Fareeha was confused, angry, and disappointed; Ana’s pattern of choosing her mission over her daughter had damaged Fareeha’s trust in her. Fareeha had grieved her mother’s death once, and this felt like losing her again. Over time, she came more to terms with Ana’s decision. Despite her lingering hurt, Fareeha had her mission, and Ana had hers.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt375f3ab5542c2b39/637da1cabbfd340e8ad2e30c/pharah-01.jpg"},{"title":"Recall","content":"Fareeha had also let go of her childhood dreams of joining Overwatch, proud of what she had built with Helix. She turned down multiple requests from Tracer, Brigitte, and Reinhardt to answer Winston’s Recall. It was only when Cole Cassidy arrived in Cairo that she seriously considered joining. Cassidy brought Ana and Fareeha together in an emotional reunion that both reopened and healed many old wounds. When Cassidy called on Pharah to back up the nascent Overwatch on a mission to counter Null Sector in Busan, she answered the call. Now the Helix hero has expanded her horizons, lending her impressive skillset to rebuild the peacekeeping agency she once idolized.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltad9ee72faf5ddb89/637da1ca32db130e11be7e31/pharah-02.jpg"}]}}
