his father passed, Hanzo was left to lead the Shimada ninja clan. The clan’s elders pushed him to bring his carefree brother, Genji, into line—leading to a confrontation where Hanzo struck Genji down. Horrified, Hanzo abandoned the clan, roaming the world in solitude as punishment.

As the eldest son of the family's head, Hanzo was bound by duty to succeed his father and rule the Shimada empire. From a young age, he was trained for that responsibility, displaying a natural aptitude for leadership and possessing an innate understanding of strategy and tactics. He also excelled in more practical areas: he was a prodigy in martial arts, swordplay, and bowmanship, having trained under swordmaster Asa Yamagami, mother of Kiriko Kamori. Upon the death of his father, the clan elders instructed Hanzo to straighten out his wayward younger brother, Genji, so that he, too, might help rule the Shimada empire. When Genji refused, Hanzo was forced to kill him. This act broke Hanzo's heart and drove him to reject his father's legacy, ultimately leading him to abandon the clan and all that he had worked so hard to attain.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt275dedbe72f14964/6388097b3b13b1106f74ec58/hanzo-00.jpg"},{"title":"Lone warrior","content":"For years, Hanzo traveled the world, perfecting his skills as a warrior, attempting to restore his honor and put the ghosts of his past to rest. His quest at last bore fruit many years after Genji’s death, when the two crossed paths—and fought—in their childhood home of Shimada Castle, which had long since been seized by the Hashimoto clan. Genji told Hanzo he had forgiven him and urged Hanzo to forgive himself. Amid new turmoil in their native Hanamura and around the world, the time may soon come when Hanzo must choose a side, but where he’ll land remains to be seen.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt8e13ccb178960434/637da1693cbefd11108110e7/hanzo-01.jpg"}]}}
