His father led the Samoan branch of the eco-rebel group, the Deepsea Raiders, that became like family to Mauga. They took him along on all their adventures, instilling in him a healthy dose of disrespect for the law. On their missions around Polynesia, Mauga learned from an early age that charisma opens doors and destruction gets answers. As the Deepsea Raiders fought against those disrespecting the beauty of their seas and islands, Mauga grew to be a renowned warrior.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt7d25f473f1a529a1/6568f8108bd09e7940d1e8af/Deep_sea_raiders.jpg"},{"title":"Two hearts","content":"Mauga became a local legend in Samoa when an intense battle left him critically wounded. A Deepsea Raider medic performed emergency heart surgery, giving him a second cybernetic heart to supplement his damaged, organic one and get back into the fight. With his newfound strength, he was victorious. The triumphant Mauga returned to Samoa, where more upgrades and surgeries awaited him. As his strength increased, so did the need for constant maintenance. Always living on the edge of death taught Mauga to live every day like it might be his last.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt5ccaa7e8f25de640/6568f8315efff8619b6a4524/Two_hearts.jpg"},{"title":"A new challenge","content":"As the Deepsea Raiders’ activity died down, Mauga was thirsty for more adventures. News of Akande Ogundimu killing the Scourge of Numbani reached him and piqued his interest. Seeing a worthy opponent in this so-called Doomfist, Mauga challenged him to a no-rules, anything-goes fight. Amused, Doomfist sensed something in the young man and agreed. The epic fight ended in a draw, with both men exhausted but unwilling to admit defeat. Impressed, Doomfist offered him a place with Talon, the promise of regular cybernetic upgrades, and all the chaos his two hearts desired.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt530d30b65538a5cb/6568f821ce06a36f1d328ade/New_challenge.jpg"},{"title":"Talon and beyond","content":"With Talon, the whole world became Mauga’s playground. He befriended Baptiste, a talented medic who ended up defecting from the organization. Mauga was tasked to track him down and bring him back, dead or alive. They met in Haiti, and Mauga convinced his old buddy to join another Talon mission to shake down a local businessman. At the end of the mission, Baptiste managed to escape once again. But Mauga didn’t mind. The chase is half the fun. Until he faces his old comrade again, Mauga remains content in Talon’s company… for now.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt02c812e1a2701956/6568f862ce06a3f075328ae2/Talon_and_beyond.jpg"}]}}
